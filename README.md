# Quotes App

This project is a mobile app built with Flutter, backed by an Express.js server for creating and reading famous quotes. The app allows users to browse, create, and save quotes.

## Features
- **Create Quotes**: Add your own custom quotes to the app.
- **Read Famous Quotes**: Fetch a collection of famous quotes.
- **Express Backend**: The server handles quote creation and provides the famous quotes.
- **Mobile Integration**: The Flutter app communicates with the backend to display and create quotes.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

### 1. Run the Server
The backend server is located in the `dist` folder. Start the server by running the precompiled `server.js` file using Node.js.

```bash
node dist/server.js
```
## 2. Find Your IP Address

To configure the app, you'll need your computer's IP address. Here's how to find it:

1. Open Command Prompt and run the following command:

    ```bash
    ipconfig
    ```

2. Look for the line that says **IPv4 Address**, and take note of your IP address.

## 3. Configure the Mobile App

In the Flutter mobile app, go to the settings page and enter your computerâ€™s IP address. This will allow the app to fetch quotes from the backend server.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: Frontend framework for building the mobile app.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for building the API server.
- **Prisma**: ORM used to interact with the database.
